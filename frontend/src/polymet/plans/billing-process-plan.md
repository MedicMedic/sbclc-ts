## TODO List
- [x] Update logistics data with billing-related mock data
- [x] Create cost analysis form component for import billing
- [x] Create SOA (Statement of Account) form component

- [x] Create main billing page with different billing types
- [x] Create collection monitoring page

## Important Notes
- Import Billing has two types: Brokerage and Forwarding
- Cost Analysis compares quotation amounts vs CA requested amounts
- SOA handles receipted expenses, Service Invoice handles non-receipted expenses
- Domestic Billing is simpler (no cost analysis needed)
- All documents need approval workflow before sending to client
- Collection monitoring tracks aging, paid, and unpaid invoices
